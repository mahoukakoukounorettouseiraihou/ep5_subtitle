00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,370
JANUARY 22, 2096

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,240
Yoshida, I've confirmed the signal
at the Tokyo Tower park.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,620
They're moving
toward the Iikura intersection now.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,040
Roger.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:26,540
I'm currently close to the Toranomon
intersection on Sakurada Street.

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,870
Changing course for the Iikura intersection.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,040
Please get there within ten minutes.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,580
I expect to be there in two.

9
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,790
Looks like we'll make it in time.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,330
After Tatsuya left the meeting he called...

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,200
the rest of us decided that I'd be in charge
of coordinating information for the parasite search.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,240
Meanwhile, Jumonji and Chiba
are leading the teams on the ground.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,910
Still...

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,410
I don't mind that Tatsuya set up
the parasite pursuit system...

15
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,870
but I'm peeved by this feeling
that he's using us.

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,540
Just you wait.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,660
On Valentine's Day, I'll give you
the bitterest chocolate ever!

18
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,040
Is something wrong, Brother?

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,660
No, it's nothing.

20
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,790
Hello? Shizuku?

21
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,370
What's up?

22
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,870
Has something happened?

23
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,450
Shizuku? Why are you dressed like that?

24
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,490
Good evening, Tatsuya and Miyuki.

25
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,620
Oh, never mind the greetings!

26
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,950
At least put a robe on!

27
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,200
If you insist...

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,040
Um...

29
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,870
Sorry to call you so late.

30
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,330
It's not especially late here.

31
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,790
Have you been drinking?

32
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,950
Alcohol?

33
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,870
No.

34
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,330
I see.

35
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,580
Anyway, what's going on?

36
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,040
I thought I should tell you
as soon as possible.

37
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,450
You already have something? That's great.

38
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,740
Praise me some more.

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,330
You're really impressive, Shizuku.

40
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,950
So, what did you learn?

41
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,700
It's about why the parasites appeared.

42
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,080
What was it?

43
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,580
An experiment to create little dark holes.

44
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,370
Dark holes?
Shizuku, what does that mean?

45
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,080
I don't know.
I thought I'd ask Tatsuya.

46
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,370
An experiment
based on extradimensional theory

47
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,620
to generate and evaporate
micro black holes, right?

48
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,040
Yes, that's it.

49
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,910
So, something like that happened.

50
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,870
What is it?

51
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,540
Put simply...

52
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,160
the experiment was to artificially
create a very small black hole

53
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,870
and harness energy from it.

54
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,330
Is that extradimensional theory?

55
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,660
Taking energy from other dimensions?

56
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,540
No, extradimensional theory isn't related
to the actual process of harnessing the energy.

57
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,950
Extradimensional theory postulates

58
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,490
that our universe is like a thin film
of three-dimensional space

59
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,790
enclosed within a higher-dimensional world

60
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:16,290
where the only physical force that can
overcome the dimensional walls is gravity.

61
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,790
Put another way, the theory is that

62
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,700
because gravity leaks a large portion
of its energy into other dimensions,

63
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,790
we can only observe it in this dimension
as a much weaker force than it actually is.

64
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,540
Miyuki, did you get that?

65
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Unfortunately,
it was a little over my head.

66
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,370
But Brother...

67
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,330
what does that have to do
with the parasites?

68
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,240
Magic isn't constrained
by the law of conservation of energy.

69
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,490
You know that it looks like magic refutes
the law of energy conservation, right?

70
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,910
They call that proposition
"the First Paradox of Modern Magic," right?

71
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,330
But that prop'sition, um...

72
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:07,490
The propersition itself
was conclud'd to be imcomplete.

73
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,790
Correct. Regarding the law
of energy conservation,

74
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:16,700
in a closed system, the total amount
of energy remains the same.

75
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,950
If you did observe a variation
in the total amount of energy,

76
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:26,370
it'd mean you've either made an observational
error or that the system wasn't closed.

77
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,830
This world, in which magic is observed,
isn't a closed system.

78
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,740
That seems related to the extradimensional
theory you explained before.

79
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,200
I get it.

80
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,160
Then, the energy magic needsh
is shupplied from another dimension?

81
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,620
Recently, there are an increasing number
of magical researchers who subscribe to that.

82
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,200
I happen to agree.

83
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,370
What I'm about to say is a hypothesis
that has no proof to support it, but...

84
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,120
Gravity acts on another dimension.

85
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,990
Wouldn't that mean it supports the walls
between dimensions by doing so? Perhaps...

86
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:11,700
...magic is drawing energy from a different
dimension without breaking that wall.

87
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,790
However,

88
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:20,660
if you generate a micro black hole using energy
calculated based on extradimensional theory,

89
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,450
gravity acting across the dimensional wall
would be erased by the black hole's generation.

90
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,790
When that happens,
for the instant the black hole is generated,

91
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,450
perhaps the dimensional wall
would end up wavering.

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,910
What would happen
if the dimensional wall wavered?

93
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:44,740
Magical energy you can't control
with magic programsh will leak through?

94
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,080
At the moment
the dimensional wall wavers,

95
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,490
information bodies of magical energy
formed in that other dimension

96
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,910
could potentially invade our world.

97
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,540
In my opinion.

98
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,240
Brother...

99
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,260
JANUARY 23, 2096 - FIRST HIGH SCHOOL

100
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,120
It was running away alone
the whole time...

101
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,740
but suddenly, there were three of them!
Don't you think that's unfair?

102
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:17,540
Um, I suppose.

103
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,660
Is she referring to the parasites?

104
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,290
Say, Erika, are you fighting with Tatsuya?

105
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,700
Wh-What are you talking about, Mizuki?

106
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,410
Of course we're not fighting!
We're good! Totally fine!

107
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,910
You don't have to get worked up about it.

108
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,540
We're not fighting.

109
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,240
It's just gotten awkward for me.

110
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,490
When all is said and done,
I just depend on Tatsuya too much.

111
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:51,660
I didn't say anything
but just assumed he'd come with us.

112
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,330
That's why when I saw him helping that girl,

113
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,870
I got ticked off and felt
like calling him a two-timer.

114
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,580
I wish I could crawl into a hole!

115
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,540
What's with that sigh as if to say,
"I'm utterly exasperated"?

116
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,700
I wouldn't say "utterly,"
but I am exasperated.

117
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,910
I thought I'd find you here.

118
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,080
Here, sandwiches.

119
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,700
Th-Thank you.

120
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,870
That's mighty thoughtful of you, Miki.

121
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,700
No, they're from Tatsuya.

122
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,330
He said you seemed to be avoiding him
and told me to bring them.

123
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,160
You see?
He hasn't forgotten you, Erika.

124
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,870
You've been left behind already.

125
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Miki!

126
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,410
What is this?

127
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,950
I've never seen an aura like this before.

128
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,410
It's okay now, Shibata.

129
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,410
Put your glasses back on.

130
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,950
It's an evil presence.

131
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,580
A parasite is in the school?

132
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,160
For what?

133
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,790
It's got guts, I'll give it that!

134
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,620
Miki, where is it?

135
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,740
Erika, calm down.

136
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,240
First, let's get our CADs.

137
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,790
Then, we'd better contact the upperclassmen.

138
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,540
You're right.

139
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,490
Mizuki, wait in the classroom.

140
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,160
I'm going, too.

141
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,290
Mizuki?

142
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,620
I have a feeling that I should go with you.

143
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,490
I don't know why, though.

144
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,240
Okay.

145
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,490
But don't leave my side.

146
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,740
Miki?

147
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,660
It'll be easier to deal with it if we're
together than if it attacks her alone.

148
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,950
Besides, Shibata's eyes
should come in handy.

149
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,740
Then, take responsibility
and protect her, Miki!

150
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,040
You don't have to tell me that.

151
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,910
Let's go, Shibata!

152
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,120
Right!

153
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,740
I sense a parasite!

154
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,910
Mia's by the side entrance!

155
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,540
Huh?

156
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,950
It can't be!

157
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,950
Miyuki, what's wrong?

158
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,620
I felt an unpleasant wave
as though it grazed my skin.

159
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,370
An unpleasant wave?

160
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,700
Was it a Psionic wave or a Pushion wave?

161
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,540
I don't know.

162
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,790
But if you didn't notice it, Brother,
then I suspect a Pushion.

163
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,200
Could it be a parasite?

164
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,870
Yes.

165
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,700
Tatsuya, it's terrible!

166
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,410
Saegusa...

167
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,290
Do you know the exact location?

168
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,580
It helps that I don't have to explain.

169
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,910
The signal is moving from the side entrance

170
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,990
toward the lab building's
service entrance for materials.

171
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,200
Maximillian employees were scheduled to do
a demo for a new measuring device today.

172
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,910
Roger that.

173
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,830
Honoka, I'm going with my brother.

174
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,580
Tatsuya! Miyuki!

175
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,040
Don't leave me here all alone!

176
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,080
VISITOR ARC V

177
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,950
Lina?

178
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,080
Mia!

179
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,040
Major...

180
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,870
Who's she?

181
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,910
That's...

182
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,790
What's wrong?

183
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,240
Oh, it's nothing.

184
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,620
She swatted at spirits no normal magician
should have been able to see.

185
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,160
She's definitely a parasite!

186
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,950
Lina...

187
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,240
I see. Then, she's an accomplice!

188
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,450
I'll throw up a barrier
to block vision and hearing.

189
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,370
It won't fool machines, but...

190
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,580
I'll do something about that.

191
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,790
Erika, not yet.

192
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,620
I know.

193
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,290
Here it goes.

194
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,830
Is that a barrier?

195
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,870
Mikihiko. He's quite skilled.

196
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,490
Its effects are visual
and auditory deprivation.

197
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,160
It won't prevent
the actual object from moving.

198
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,040
What is this? Are we surrounded?

199
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,290
Watch out!

200
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:37,940
Crap!

201
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,830
Erika?

202
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,370
What do you think you're doing, Erika?

203
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,700
Katsuto Jumonji?

204
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,790
Mia!

205
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,040
She caught it with her bare hand!

206
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,950
And that was a powerful stroke!

207
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,540
Mia?

208
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,450
Lina, can you hear me?

209
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,830
Silvie?

210
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,740
Thank goodness, I finally got through!

211
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,910
I've discovered who White Mask is!

212
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,450
It was Mia!

213
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,740
The person behind the white mask
is Mikaela Hongou!

214
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,950
Mia!

215
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,490
You were the one in the white mask?

216
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,790
What, now you wanna fight?

217
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,240
Healing Magic?
She healed that wound instantly?

218
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,290
It looks like we're dealing
with a real monster.

219
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,120
In that case, how about this?

220
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,450
Shucks.

221
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,700
That was so quick, Miyuki.

222
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,660
Lina, she seems to be
an acquaintance of yours...

223
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,870
but we'll be taking her.

224
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,540
Fine.

225
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,870
Wait a second!

226
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,790
You can't just take her away.

227
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,040
If this is the woman who hurt Leo,

228
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,830
I won't give her to anyone else,
not even you.

229
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,830
As long as you share
what you come up with.

230
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,910
I'll contact you.

231
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,790
Jumonji...

232
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,910
Thank you.

233
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,870
Look out!

234
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,660
Still frozen.

235
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,080
She can't be conscious,
let alone use magic.

236
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,120
Is that...

237
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,870
Self-destruct?

238
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,830
Get down!

239
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,120
Ball lightning?

240
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,580
There's no sign of a caster.

241
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,620
That must be the parasite!

242
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,370
That's strange.

243
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,790
Why doesn't it run?

244
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,450
Why do you think, Shiba?

245
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,120
I don't know whether
it's deliberate or instinctual...

246
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,580
but it seems to have a reason
for keeping us here.

247
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,910
Lina, you got anything?

248
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:18,660
Parasites possess humans and alter them.

249
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,160
Searching for a host

250
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,120
is apparently their behavioral principle,
equivalent to a self-preservation instinct.

251
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,580
In other words,

252
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,540
it's looking for the next person
to possess?

253
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,120
Probably.

254
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,490
How?

255
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,040
That's what I'd like to know.

256
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,410
Useless...

257
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,330
Well, excuse me!

258
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,910
This is bad.

259
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,700
It's after Erika!

260
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,870
Did it detect that Erika doesn't have
any way to resist it?

261
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,830
If I at least knew where it is now,
I could do something, but...

262
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,410
Yoshida, please undo the barrier.

263
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,660
Shibata, what are you...

264
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,490
I might be able to tell where it is.

265
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,200
Forget it. It would be too much for you.

266
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,620
There's no telling what'll happen if you look
directly at it now that its energy is released.

267
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,990
Worst-case, you could go blind.

268
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,450
When I chose to be a magician,
I was prepared for the risks.

269
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,870
Erika's in danger, isn't she?

270
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,040
If I can't help her now...

271
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,830
there's no reason for me to be here.

272
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,580
Okay.

273
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,790
Put this around your neck.

274
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,330
If you think you're in danger,
cover your eyes with it.

275
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,160
It should be more effective
than your glasses.

276
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,240
Like this?

277
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,740
Promise me.

278
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,540
Promise me you won't do
anything reckless.

279
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,410
Erika wouldn't want anyone
to sacrifice themselves for her.

280
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,910
I promise.

281
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,120
Here it goes.

282
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,200
Ready!

283
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,990
That's...

284
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,540
the parasite!

285
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,290
Over there!

286
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,160
About two meters above Erika!

287
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,450
One meter to the right,
50 centimeters behind!

288
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:39,490
There's a point of contact there
that the monster is using!

289
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,040
Anti-demon spell...

290
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,290
Garudaflame!

291
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,490
Mikihiko's Spirit Magic...

292
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,240
Before, I was unable to get more
than a vague impression of the parasite,

293
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,040
but I can see it clearly now.

294
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,080
By Mizuki perceiving it...

295
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,910
has its existence in the physical dimension
been strengthened?

296
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,830
If so...

297
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,910
then Mizuki is in danger now!

298
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,000
It's coming!

299
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,200
Shibata!

300
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,990
Where is it?

301
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,700
There!

302
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,700
Tatsuya!

303
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,830
It got away.

304
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,080
We must've hurt it.

305
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,660
And we should be thankful
none of us got hurt this time.

306
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:58,540
If I'd used Gram Demolition then,
the parasite would've been blown away.

307
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,620
But I didn't, and it got away.

308
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,410
I knew that.

309
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:07,450
From the perspective
of combat objective completion,

310
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,990
the end result is that we barely
managed not to lose anything.

311
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,580
What a disgrace.

312
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,080
VISITOR ARC VI
