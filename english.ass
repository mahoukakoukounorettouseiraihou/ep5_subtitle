Dialogue: 0,0:06:58.12,0:07:02.99,Default,,0,0,0,,Wouldn't that mean it supports the walls\Nbetween dimensions by doing so? Perhaps...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.54,0:07:11.70,Default,,0,0,0,,...magic is drawing energy from a different\Ndimension without breaking that wall.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.37,0:07:14.79,Default,,0,0,0,,However,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:14.79,0:07:20.66,Default,,0,0,0,,if you generate a micro black hole using energy\Ncalculated based on extradimensional theory,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:20.66,0:07:26.45,Default,,0,0,0,,gravity acting across the dimensional wall\Nwould be erased by the black hole's generation.
